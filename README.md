# Derby Game!

This is game developed for a party with all of my friends! Everyone made their own horses at the beginning of the party and then we competed to see who made the best horse! 

Start the virtual environment 

```
source derby-env/bin/activate
```

If it is the first time running the virtual environment, install Pygame (pip required)

```
pip install pygame
```

Run the game

```
python3 main.py
```

Check out the formatting in `assets/maps.json`, `assets/horses.json`, and the `imgs/` directory for how to make your own derby!
